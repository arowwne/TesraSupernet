What is Tesra Supernet?
=====================================
Tesra Supernet is a basic network that provides value transmission for AI computing network. He innovatively uses computing power to prove it, uses PoVC as consensus mechanism, supports lightning network, fast payment function, supports anonymous transaction, zero knowledge proof function. The problem of insufficient computing resources of artificial intelligence is solved. In the future, Tesra Supernet chain can also provide a good customer experience in large-scale commercial DAPP, so that it can carry a variety of intelligent contract applications.<br/>

Tesra Supernet Innovate
=====================================
#### Adopt PoVC consensus mechanism
The consensus mechanism of Tesra Supernet adopts PoVC algorithm, synthesizes the PoW PoS algorithm, and on this basis, the upgrade update is made. The total amount of Tesra Supernet.Tesra Supernet used to generate and distribute Tesra Supernet.Tesra Supernet is constant, which is 10 billion. PoW mining is used, which is similar to Bitcoin network mining. Bitcoin network has been running for nearly 10 years, and there has been no obvious problem. Its PoW consensus mechanism and economic model based on it will be more robust than other consensus mechanisms.<br/>

The PoS consensus mechanism is used to package Tesra Supernet transactions, and it will be safer to handle transactions faster with the generation of. Tesra Supernet and the separation of transaction packaging. If 51% attack occurs in computing power concentration, it can only affect the generation of subsequent Tesra Supernet, and can not tamper with historical transactions to ensure the security of user account assets.

Tesra Supernet Plan
=====================================
#### Support for lightning network, fast payment function
Tesra Supernet constructs a double-layer network of transaction confirmation and modifies the underlying network transport protocol to shorten the block confirmation time. The double-layer network confirmed by ordinary transaction refers to the network composed of the main node (including super node) of ordinary pos node (abbreviated as ordinary node). The ordinary node is responsible for packaging and trading. After packing, it is broadcast to the super node and other main nodes to which the main node is linked. Super nodes are similar to CDN nodes in the field of traditional Internet, which mainly solve the problem of data synchronization and have no other privileges in consensus. If the customer initiates an instant transfer transaction in InstantSend mode, the input to the transaction will be locked to the corresponding specific transaction, the transaction will reach a locked consensus on the primary node network, and all transactions and blocks that conflict with it will be rejected forever. Unless they match the transaction that was locked at the time corresponding to the ID.. At present, the locking time of the whole network transaction is about 1 second; therefore, the fast transaction with InstantSend can achieve secure 1 second arrival, which we call second to second.<br/>

Tesra Supernet also modifies the underlying network transmission protocol, one is to make the information transmission of ordinary network confirm faster, the other is to make the transmission of cross-border network break through some restrictions and solve the problem of cross-border payment in complex scenarios of network environment. This paper mainly modifies the underlying network transmission protocol stack so that the ordinary nodes can exchange information at high speed under the protocol of the primary node. This mode has high requirements for the network environment in which the super nodes are located.

#### Support for anonymous transactions, zero knowledge proof function
Zero knowledge proof refers to the fact that we can fully prove that they are the legitimate owners of certain rights and interests, without leaking out the relevant information-that is, the "knowledge" given to the outside world is "zero". Tesra Supernet can trade anonymously to protect data privacy on Tesra Supernet. When the data is owned by the individual, the personal information can be used and exchanged effectively without disclosing privacy. In this respect, Tesra Supernet can be extended to use scenarios such as encrypted communication and data isolation.<br/>

#### Tesra Supernet solves the problem of insufficient Computing Resources of artificial Intelligence
Based on the Terra Supernet block chain technology, a distributed super-computing network is developed, which can provide a low-cost and flexible computing service for AI developers. The computing node in the network may be a small and medium-sized GPU server or a GPU mine. The Tesla mining program calculation node will obtain a return on the basis of the actual task amount contribution, and the block chain will complete the calculation and allocation of the entire award.<br/>

The scattered GPU resources are integrated to form AI supercomputing network, and it provides powerful computing support for the research and development of artificial intelligence, which will make Tesra Supernet become the next generation computing platform of artificial intelligence industry.<br/>

Based on the essence of Tesra Supernet on the chain, it is a DAPP, implemented by intelligent contract. It can realize the deep learning function on the chain. Make the blockchain better serve the traditional real economy.
