Tesra Supernet Innovate
=====================================
#### Support for Lightning Network, Fast Payment Function
Tesra Supernet constructs a double-layer network of transaction confirmation and modifies the underlying network transport protocol to shorten the block confirmation time. The double-layer network confirmed by ordinary transaction refers to the network composed of the main node (including super node) of ordinary pos node (abbreviated as ordinary node). The ordinary node is responsible for packaging and trading. After packing, it is broadcast to the super node and other main nodes to which the main node is linked. Super nodes are similar to CDN nodes in the field of traditional Internet, which mainly solve the problem of data synchronization and have no other privileges in consensus. If the customer initiates an instant transfer transaction in InstantSend mode, the input to the transaction will be locked to the corresponding specific transaction, the transaction will reach a locked consensus on the primary node network, and all transactions and blocks that conflict with it will be rejected forever. Unless they match the transaction that was locked at the time corresponding to the ID.. At present, the locking time of the whole network transaction is about 1 second; therefore, the fast transaction with InstantSend can achieve secure 1 second arrival, which we call second to second.<br/>

Tesra Supernet also modifies the underlying network transmission protocol, one is to make the information transmission of ordinary network confirm faster, the other is to make the transmission of cross-border network break through some restrictions and solve the problem of cross-border payment in complex scenarios of network environment. This paper mainly modifies the underlying network transmission protocol stack so that the ordinary nodes can exchange information at high speed under the protocol of the primary node. This mode has high requirements for the network environment in which the super nodes are located.

#### Support for Anonymous Transactions, Zero Knowledge Proof Function
Zero knowledge proof refers to the fact that we can fully prove that they are the legitimate owners of certain rights and interests, without leaking out the relevant information-that is, the "knowledge" given to the outside world is "zero". Tesra Supernet can trade anonymously to protect data privacy on Tesra Supernet. When the data is owned by the individual, the personal information can be used and exchanged effectively without disclosing privacy. In this respect, Tesra Supernet can be extended to use scenarios such as encrypted communication and data isolation.<br/>

#### Adopt PoVC Consensus Mechanism
The consensus mechanism of Tesra Supernet adopts PoVC algorithm, synthesizes the PoW PoS algorithm, and on this basis, the upgrade update is made. The total amount of Tesra Supernet.Tesra Supernet used to generate and distribute Tesra Supernet.Tesra Supernet is constant, which is 10 billion. PoW mining is used, which is similar to Bitcoin network mining. Bitcoin network has been running for nearly 10 years, and there has been no obvious problem. Its PoW consensus mechanism and economic model based on it will be more robust than other consensus mechanisms.<br/>

The PoS consensus mechanism is used to package Tesra Supernet transactions, and it will be safer to handle transactions faster with the generation of. Tesra Supernet and the separation of transaction packaging. If 51% attack occurs in computing power concentration, it can only affect the generation of subsequent Tesra Supernet, and can not tamper with historical transactions to ensure the security of user account assets.

#### Tesra Supernet Solves the Problem of Insufficient Computing Resources of Artificial Intelligence
Based on the Terra Supernet block chain technology, a distributed super-computing network is developed, which can provide a low-cost and flexible computing service for AI developers. The computing node in the network may be a small and medium-sized GPU server or a GPU mine. The Tesla mining program calculation node will obtain a return on the basis of the actual task amount contribution, and the block chain will complete the calculation and allocation of the entire award.





#### II. Advantages of Our Solutions<br/>

##### A. The Adoption of PoVC<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet employs the PoVC algorithm for its consensus mechanism and integrates PoW+PoS with a later update on all as a whole. PoW is involved to produce and distribute Tesra Supernet, which totals 100 billion and adopts PoW to mine, a way similar to mining on bitcoin network. No big problem ever happened to bitcoin network over the 10 years of its operation, proving PoW consensus mechanism and economy model based on it more stable than others alike.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet also uses PoS to pack transactions for a faster process and security after block production. In cases where 51% attacks take place due to concentrated computing power, no history transactions will be able to be changed other than some impacts on subsequent production, the assets under user accounts are hence secured.<br/>

##### B. Solutions for Lengthy Block Confirmation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-layered network is built for confirmation of transactions on Tesra Supernet, paired with changes to the internet communication protocol to reduce the time used for block confirmation. The normal two-layered confirmation network refers to a combination of PoS nodes (also refered to as normal nodes) and master nodes (including super nodes) while on the one hand, the former is responsible for packing transactions and broadcasting to the super node and others that are linked to the master node, the super node, on the other hand, resembles CDN nodes in the traditional internet and is responsible for data synchronization without any other privileges on consensus. If the client chooses InstantSend model for real-time transfer, the inputs will be locked to a specified transaction, and the transaction will reach the consensus on master node network which will fail all transactions or blocks that don’t conform to the consensus unless they correctly match with the ID for the locked transaction. As it takes about 1 second to lock the transactions at present, we use InstantSend to guarantee safe transactions within one second, which we also call arrival by second.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the changes to the Internet communication protocol, Tesra Supernet has managed to quicken the information transmission on network, and help break some restrictions on cross-border transmissions to solve the problems of payment between countries under complicated web environment. To name the details, this is achieved by alterations to the protocol stack, making it possible for the normal nodes to exchange information rapidly under the protocol of the master node, which has a higher requirement for the internet environment where the super node exists.<br/>

##### C. Zero—Knowledge Proof to Settle the Privacy Problem<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero—knowledge proof denotes proving legal ownership of some rights while not disclosing relevant information—no knowledge exposed to others. Anonymous transactions are allowed on Tesra Supernet to protect data. One’s data owned solely by himself are secured being used or exchanged. Tesra Supernet may engage encrypted communication and data isolation in its applications in the future.<br/>

##### D. Insufficient AI Computational Resources Solutions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the blockchain technology, Tesra Supernet has developed a distributed super computing network that provides AI developers with economical and flexible computing services. The computing nodes in the network can be GPU from SMEs, GPU mine. The computing nodes of Tesra mining procedure acquire rewards according to the actual contributions made through task execution when the rewards will be calculated and distributed by blockchain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet will serve as a platform of new generation by integrating global GPU resources for the formation of a AI super computing network to offer powerful support to AI R&D with computing services.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain-based Tesra Supernet is in nature a DAPP achieved by applying smart contract and a platform where deep learning is available on chain. In this way the traditional real economy is better served by blockchain.<br/>

#### III. Future Application Value<br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra proposes a direct solution for the high cost of computation facing enterprises. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the major network goes online, Tesra will also enable trade for user-defined data sets and models on the platform in a bid to creating a complete network ecology.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra also eyes on meaningful applications in the industry, big data cleaning, supply chain finance, to name a few. And we have developed many clients interested in those applications.<br/>
