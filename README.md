Tesra Supernet Core integration/staging tree
=====================================


### Project Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet is applied AI computing platform with decentralized architecture, which integrates computation power around the world and AI developers via community token value system, forming a virtual hyper-computer to meet rapidly growing demands of Artificial Intelligence.
  

#### I. Project Background<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a landmark project chain project in the age of blockchain 3.0, Tesra Supernet features two major functions as transactions by second and updated user privacy. It is to bring better user experience to the large-scale commercial DAPP in the future, enabling the latter to embrace smart contract applications of various kinds.<br/>

#### II. Advantages of Our Solutions<br/>

##### A. The Adoption of PoVC<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet employs the PoVC algorithm for its consensus mechanism and integrates PoW+PoS with a later update on all as a whole. PoW is involved to produce and distribute Tesra Supernet, which totals 100 billion and adopts PoW to mine, a way similar to mining on bitcoin network. No big problem ever happened to bitcoin network over the 10 years of its operation, proving PoW consensus mechanism and economy model based on it more stable than others alike.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet also uses PoS to pack transactions for a faster process and security after block production. In cases where 51% attacks take place due to concentrated computing power, no history transactions will be able to be changed other than some impacts on subsequent production, the assets under user accounts are hence secured.<br/>

##### B. Solutions for Lengthy Block Confirmation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-layered network is built for confirmation of transactions on Tesra Supernet, paired with changes to the internet communication protocol to reduce the time used for block confirmation. The normal two-layered confirmation network refers to a combination of PoS nodes (also refered to as normal nodes) and master nodes (including super nodes) while on the one hand, the former is responsible for packing transactions and broadcasting to the super node and others that are linked to the master node, the super node, on the other hand, resembles CDN nodes in the traditional internet and is responsible for data synchronization without any other privileges on consensus. If the client chooses InstantSend model for real-time transfer, the inputs will be locked to a specified transaction, and the transaction will reach the consensus on master node network which will fail all transactions or blocks that don’t conform to the consensus unless they correctly match with the ID for the locked transaction. As it takes about 1 second to lock the transactions at present, we use InstantSend to guarantee safe transactions within one second, which we also call arrival by second.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the changes to the Internet communication protocol, Tesra Supernet has managed to quicken the information transmission on network, and help break some restrictions on cross-border transmissions to solve the problems of payment between countries under complicated web environment. To name the details, this is achieved by alterations to the protocol stack, making it possible for the normal nodes to exchange information rapidly under the protocol of the master node, which has a higher requirement for the internet environment where the super node exists.<br/>

##### C. Zero—Knowledge Proof to Settle the Privacy Problem<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero—knowledge proof denotes proving legal ownership of some rights while not disclosing relevant information—no knowledge exposed to others. Anonymous transactions are allowed on Tesra Supernet to protect data. One’s data owned solely by himself are secured being used or exchanged. Tesra Supernet may engage encrypted communication and data isolation in its applications in the future.<br/>

##### D. Insufficient AI Computational Resources Solutions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the blockchain technology, Tesra Supernet has developed a distributed super computing network that provides AI developers with economical and flexible computing services. The computing nodes in the network can be GPU from SMEs, GPU mine. The computing nodes of Tesra mining procedure acquire rewards according to the actual contributions made through task execution when the rewards will be calculated and distributed by blockchain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra Supernet will serve as a platform of new generation by integrating global GPU resources for the formation of a AI super computing network to offer powerful support to AI R&D with computing services.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain-based Tesra Supernet is in nature a DAPP achieved by applying smart contract and a platform where deep learning is available on chain. In this way the traditional real economy is better served by blockchain.<br/>

#### III. Future Application Value<br/> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra proposes a direct solution for the high cost of computation facing enterprises. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the major network goes online, Tesra will also enable trade for user-defined data sets and models on the platform in a bid to creating a complete network ecology.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesra also eyes on meaningful applications in the industry, big data cleaning, supply chain finance, to name a few. And we have developed many clients interested in those applications.<br/>
